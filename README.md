# ScriptedEvents
SCP:SL Exiled plugin to create event "scripts". These scripts can be set up to run once per round, multiple times per round, or by command only.

## For server hosts
All documentation for this plugin can be found on its [wiki](https://github.com/Thundermaker300/ScriptedEvents/wiki). The wiki contains code samples and information about every action, variable, and supported conditions.

The parent command for this plugin is `scriptedevents` (aliases: `script`, `scr`). Running this command will show examples on how to use it.

### Permissions
* `script.execute` - Execute a script.
* `script.list` - View all scripts.
* `script.read` - Read a script.
* `script.stopall` - Stop all running scripts.

### Default Config
```yml
scripted_events:
  # Whether or not to enable the Scripted Events plugin.
  is_enabled: true
  debug: false
  # Enable logs for starting/stopping scripts.
  enable_logs: true
  # List of scripts to run as soon as the round starts.
  auto_run_scripts: []
  # List of scripts to automatically re-run as soon as they finish.
  loop_scripts: []
  # Define a custom set of actions and the action they run when used.
  aliases:
  - command: LOCKDOORBRIEF
    execute: DOOR LOCK * 10
  # Define a custom set of permissions used to run a certain script. The provided permission will be added AFTER script.execute (eg. script.execute.examplepermission for the provided example).
  required_permissions:
    ExampleScriptNameHere: examplepermission
```

## For developers
There are two methods for adding your own actions to ScriptedEvents in your plugin.

### Directly Referencing Plugin
This method works by adding a reference to the plugin.

Create a new class, it needs to inherit `ScriptedEvents.API.Actions.IAction`, then implement this interface.

Then, in your OnEnabled, add `ScriptedEvents.API.ApiHelper.RegisterActions();`

The problem with using this method is that your plugin will ONLY function if ScriptedEvents is also installed, which is not ideal servers may use your plugin but not ScriptedEvents.

### Reflection
The alternative to the above method is by using reflection to access the `ApiHelper` class. From there, call the `RegisterCustomAction(string, Func<string[], Tuple<bool, string>>)` method.

The above method takes a string, the name of the plugin, and it takes a defined function. This function gives you a `string[]`, representing the arguments that were given from the script. It must return a `Tuple<bool, string>`, with the bool representing whether or not execution was successful, and the message to show. If it is NOT successful, a message should be provided. If it is successful, a message is optional (should be set to `string.Empty`).

If your plugin is disabled in-game, and Scripted Events is still running, this may cause a problem if a script uses your action. As such, it is recommended to call the `ApiHelper.UnregisterCustomAction(string name)` method if your action is no longer usable.

For ease of debugging, both `RegisterCustomAction` and `UnregisterCustomAction` return a string message representing whether or not they were successful.

This method is much more recommended, as your plugin does not need to have Scripted Events installed in order for your plugin to function. However, it is not as straight forward as the previous method, and reflection is significantly slower than the previous method (which is why you only need to use it once in your plugin).

To view an example of this method in action, see the [Round Reports](https://github.com/Thundermaker300/RoundReports/blob/master/RoundReports/ScriptedEventsIntegration.cs) implementation of it.
